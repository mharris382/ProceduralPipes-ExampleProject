# ProceduralPipes-ExampleProject

# Project Setup
This example project uses UE 5.7 and requires the ProceduralPipes plugin has been installed.   [The plugin is freely available on Fab, here](https://www.fab.com/listings/8ac12f8e-3f11-4a5b-9df1-9ff826e7e17d).  Make sure you have the plugin installed to Unreal 5.7 on your machine.  Then you can clone or download the project files from this page.   

Note: The unreal project file is not in the root folder of this repo, it is located in PA_PipesSample.

# Example Contents

Example Assets are provided inside `Content->ProceduralPipeKits` folder.  The master material contains the shared pipe material, and each kit is grouped into subfolder (containing attribution .text files for that kit).  This should make it convientent to migrate the desired mesh kit into your own projects (be sure to provide attribution to the creator).
